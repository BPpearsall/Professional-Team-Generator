# Professional Team Generator

## Description
In this program I want to be able to dynamically create cards that will house basic information about my team's manager, engineers and interns.

## Process
Through the usage of Node and Inquirer, I ask the user multiple prompts in the terminal, and their answers are logged and will dynamically create and HTML page with all the relevant information.
