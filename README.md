# Professional Team Generator

## Description
In this program I want to be able to dynamically create cards that will house basic information about my team's manager, engineers and interns.

## Process
Through the usage of Node and Inquirer, I ask the user multiple prompts in the terminal, and their answers are logged and will dynamically create and HTML page with all the relevant information.

When I run node i'm asked to input information about the manager

After inputting informationa about the manager i'm given a prompt asking if I want to add an engineer, intern, or to end the inquiry. 

When I select engineer, I am asked to input information that will dynamically create a Engineer card on team.html

When I select Intern, I am asked to input information that will dynamically create a Intern card on team.html

When I select no more team members, the node kills the inquiry and creates the team.html
